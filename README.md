# API playground

Basic front end application to test the api endpoints and data retrieval from a local instance of a Strapi API

You will need to create a `.env` file at the root of the project containing the root of the API, using the name `REACT_APP_SITE_URL`. For local this should be `http://localhost:1337`, otherwise use the base url of the deployed backend.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode at http://localhost:3000
